# Regex Tutorial

This is a simple tutorial on regular expressions for Javascript. Below you can find a table of contents that can navigate you to the different sections of the tutorial.
Hope you enjoy and benefit from this tutorial.

## Summary

A **regex**, which is short for **regular expression**, is a sequence of characters that defines a specific search pattern. When included in code or search algorithms, regular expressions can be used to find certain patterns of characters within a string, or to find and replace a character or sequence of characters within a string. They are also frequently used to validate input. 

The regex I will be describing is the following
/^.*$/i 
will bring back "Ilove2CODE"

## Regex Components

### Anchors
Anchors are characters that are within the regex and allow the user to search for strings that match the begining or ending.

Expression	Description

[^abc]	Find any character NOT between the brackets
[^0-9]	Find any character NOT between the brackets (any non-digit)

### Quantifiers
Quantifiers define how many characters are with the regex, which helps the user specifiy how many instances a characters.
Below you can find some examples of quantifiers.
.*	Matches any string that contains zero or more occurrences total
n*	Matches any string that contains zero or more occurrences of n
n+	Matches any string that contains at least one n


### Grouping Constructs
In regex constructs can be grouped using paranthesis.
The following regex (123):(abc)
would be considered two groups.


### Bracket Expressions
Sqaure brackets in regex represents a range of characters that the user would like to match. Bracket expressions will use the range of characters in any order to search for regex that match the parameters.

### Character Classes
Character classes tells the regex whether there is a specific whitespace, digit, or a alphabet.


### The OR Operator
The OR operator can be written as the following "|" and it literally means or.
The OR operator can be used within javascript when assigning if else statements as well as regex expressions.

### Flags
Flags are one of the optional parameters of a regex. The define the limits for the regex. Some examples can be found below.
g-Global search (searches globally for all possible matches in a string)
i-Case sensitive search (will decide if the regex should ignore case when searching for a string)
m-multi line search (searches multiple lines for the matching string)

### Character Escapes
It can be very useful in knowing the different character classes when using regex.
Some examples of different character classes can be alpha, alphanumeric, special characters, etc.
Some common character classes can include
Here are some of the other common character classes:

.— Will match any character

\d— Will match any numeric digit. This class is equivalent to the bracket expression [0-9].

\w— Will match an alphanumeric character as well as the underscore (_). This class is equivalent to the bracket expression [A-Za-z0-9_].

\s— Will match a single whitespace character, linebreak, tab/indent.
